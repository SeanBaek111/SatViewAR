# SatViewAR 

## Abstract
This iPhone application leverages AR (Augmented Reality) technology to visually map satellites that can be received at the user's current location in three-dimensional space. This intuitive method aids in identifying Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) satellites, a common issue in urban canyons, forested, and mountainous areas where GPS errors can range from a few to tens of meters. Additionally, AI is incorporated to enhance the determination of the NLOS state of satellites. The app presents a fast, convenient, and low-cost solution for NLOS detection, improving accuracy in various fields such as autonomous driving, aviation, and military operations.

## Features

- **AR Visualization**: Use your iPhone to see and identify satellites in three-dimensional space around you.
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Our advanced AI algorithms determine the NLOS status of each satellite.
- **Easy to Use**: A user-friendly interface that does not require technical expertise to operate.
- **Portable**: As an iPhone app, it provides a mobile solution to be used in various outdoor environments.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Connect your iPhone to your computer and select it as the build destination in Xcode.
4. Press the 'Run' button to build and run the application on your device.

Make sure you have the latest version of Xcode installed and a valid Apple Developer account to run the app on a device.

## Usage

After launching the app, point your iPhone to the sky. The AR view will display satellites currently above the horizon. Satellites will be color-coded based on their NLOS status, as determined by the integrated AI model.
